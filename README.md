# Etch-a-Sketch-DOM-Manipulation
I created a simply application that allowed boxes to turn black upon the mouse hovering. However, I also used DOM manipulation to implement funtionality to allow these buttons to return back to their normal states. This project taught me the fundamentals of selecting and query objects within the DOM and learning the relationships between different HTML elements.
